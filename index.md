## professional experience

Over 20 years software engineering; 14 of those are mobile focused, with the last 10 specialising in iOS as a contractor.

Equally happy working in development teams or being the solo iOS developer on-site. I'm fortunate to have worked with some great clients in both the private and public sector.

Swift, Objective C, Python, Java, Golang, C, some C++ and C#. And 6502 :)

## education

BSc (Hons) Computer Science, Edinburgh.
